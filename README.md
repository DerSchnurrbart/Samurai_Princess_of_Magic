# Samurai_Princess_of_Magic
A game designed with "VI" accessibility in mind.


Instead of killing all enemies of a type in one direction when player attacks, player now only can attack closest enemy in the direction chosen. If enemy is weak to the weapon type, the enemy will die.

Added death SFX. Attempted to get death SFX to trigger when enemies die, but SFX do not play some reason.

Bugs: Noticed there is a bug(s) regarding an enemy coming from the left or right, where you cannot kill them until they've passed to the other side of you.
